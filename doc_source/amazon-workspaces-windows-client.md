## Requirements<a name="windows-requirements"></a>

The Amazon WorkSpaces Windows client application requires Microsoft Windows 7, Windows 8, or Windows 10\.

## Setup and Installation<a name="windows_setup"></a>

Download and install the Windows client application from [Amazon WorkSpaces Client Downloads](https://clients.amazonworkspaces.com/)\.

## Determining Your Client Version<a name="determine-version-windows"></a>

To see which version of the WorkSpaces client you have, choose **Amazon WorkSpaces**, **About Amazon WorkSpaces**, or click the gear icon in the upper\-right corner and choose **About Amazon WorkSpaces**\.

## Connecting to Your WorkSpace<a name="windows_connecting"></a>

To connect to your WorkSpace, complete the following procedure\.

### To connect to your WorkSpace for 3\.0\+ clients<a name="windows_connecting-new-clients"></a>

1. The first time that you run the client application, you are prompted for your registration code, which is contained in your welcome email\. The Amazon WorkSpaces client application uses the registration code and user name to identify which WorkSpace to connect to\. When you launch the client application later, the same registration code is used\. To enter a different registration code, launch the client application, and then on the menu bar, choose **Settings**, **Manage Login Information**\.

1. Enter your user name and password in the login screen and choose **Sign In**\. If your Amazon WorkSpaces administrator has enabled multi\-factor authentication for your organization's WorkSpaces, you are prompted for a passcode to complete your login\. Your Amazon WorkSpaces administrator will provide more information about how to obtain your passcode\.

1. If your Amazon WorkSpaces administrator has not disabled the **Keep me logged in** feature, you can select the **Keep me logged in** check box at the bottom of the login screen to save your credentials securely so that you can connect to your WorkSpace easily while the client application remains running\. Your credentials are securely cached up to the maximum lifetime of your Kerberos ticket\.

   After the client application connects to your WorkSpace, your WorkSpace desktop is displayed\.

### To connect to your WorkSpace for 1\.0\+ and 2\.0\+ clients<a name="windows_connecting-legacy-clients"></a>

1. The first time that you run the client application, you are prompted for your registration code, which is contained in your welcome email\. The Amazon WorkSpaces client application uses the registration code and user name to identify which WorkSpace to connect to\. When you launch the client application later, the same registration code is used\. To enter a different registration code, launch the client application, and then on the menu bar, choose **Options**, **Manage Registrations**\.

1. Enter your user name and password in the login screen and choose **Sign In**\. If your Amazon WorkSpaces administrator has enabled multi\-factor authentication for your organization's WorkSpaces, you are prompted for a passcode to complete your login\. Your Amazon WorkSpaces administrator will provide more information about how to obtain your passcode\.

1. If your Amazon WorkSpaces administrator has not disabled the "Remember Me" feature, you are prompted to save your credentials securely so that you can connect to your WorkSpace easily while the client application remains running\. Your credentials are securely cached up to the maximum lifetime of your Kerberos ticket\.

   After the client application connects to your WorkSpace, your WorkSpace desktop is displayed\.

An interruption of network connectivity causes an active session to be disconnected\. This can be caused by events such as closing the laptop lid, or the loss of your wireless network connection\. The Amazon WorkSpaces client application for Windows attempts to reconnect the session automatically if network connectivity is regained within a certain amount of time\. The default session resume timeout is 20 minutes, but this timeout can be modified by your network administrator\.

## Managing Your Login Information \(3\.0\+ Clients Only\)<a name="manage-login-info-windows"></a>

You can view your registration code and what Region your WorkSpace is in\. You can specify whether you want the WorkSpaces client application to save your current registration code, and you can assign a name to your WorkSpace\. You can also specify if you want Amazon WorkSpaces to keep you logged in to a WorkSpace until you quit or your login period expires\.

**To manage your login information for a WorkSpace**

1. In the Amazon WorkSpaces client application, go to **Settings**, **Manage Login Information**\.

1. In the **Manage Login Information** dialog box, you can see the registration code and Region information for your WorkSpace\.

1. \(Optional\) If you want the WorkSpaces client to remember your current registration code, select the **Remember Registration Code** check box\.

1. Under **Saved registration codes**, select the WorkSpace that you want to name\.

1. In the **WorkSpace name** box, enter a name for the WorkSpace\.

1. \(Optional\) If you want WorkSpaces to keep you logged in until you quit or your login period expires, select the **Keep me logged in** check box\.

1. Choose **Save**\.

## Client Views<a name="windows_views"></a>

You can switch to full screen mode by choosing **View**, **Enter Full Screen** \(3\.0\+ clients\) or **View**, **Show Fullscreen** \(1\.0\+ and 2\.0\+ clients\) in the client application menu\.

While in full screen mode, you can switch back to window mode by moving the pointer to the top of the screen\. The client application menu is displayed, and you can choose **View**, **Leave Full Screen** \(3\.0\+ clients\) or **View**, **Exit Fullscreen** \(1\.0\+ and 2\.0\+ clients\) in the client application menu\.

## Client Language<a name="windows_client_lang"></a>

You can select the language displayed by the client by performing the following steps\.

**Note**  
The WorkSpaces client applications support Japanese\. However, Japanese WorkSpaces are available only in the Asia Pacific \(Tokyo\) Region\.

**To select the client language**

1. Depending on which client you're using, do one of the following\.    
[\[See the AWS documentation website for more details\]](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/workspaces/latest/userguide/amazon-workspaces-windows-client.html)

1. Enter your desired language in the **Select a language** list and choose **Save**\.

1. Restart the client\.

## Display Support<a name="windows-display-support"></a>

Amazon WorkSpaces supports a maximum of four displays and a maximum resolution of 3840x2160 \(ultra\-high definition, or UHD\)\. The maximum supported resolution depends on the number of displays, as shown in the following table\.


| Displays | Resolution | 
| --- | --- | 
|  2  |  3840x2160  | 
|  4  |  1920x1200  | 

The Amazon WorkSpaces client application extracts the Extended Display Information Data \(EDID\) of all attached displays and determines the best compatibility match before starting the session\. If you have a High DPI display, the client application automatically scales the streaming window according to your local DPI settings\.

## Proxy Server<a name="windows_proxy_server"></a>

If your network requires you to use a proxy server to access the internet, you can enable the Amazon WorkSpaces client application to use a proxy for HTTPS \(port 443\) traffic\. Proxy with authentication is not currently supported\.

**Note**  
The Amazon WorkSpaces client applications use the HTTPS port for updates, registration, and authentication\. The desktop streaming connections to the WorkSpace require port 4172 to be enabled, and do not go through the proxy server\. 

### To use a proxy server for 3\.0\+ clients<a name="windows_proxy_server-new-clients"></a>

1. In the Amazon WorkSpaces client application, go to **Settings**, **Manage Proxy Server**\.

1. In the **Set Proxy** dialog box, select **Use proxy server**, enter the proxy server address and port, and choose **Save**\.

### To use a proxy server for 1\.0\+ and 2\.0\+ clients<a name="windows_proxy_server-legacy-clients"></a>

1. In the Amazon WorkSpaces client application, open the **Advanced Settings** dialog box\.

1. In the **Proxy Server Setting** area, select **Use Proxy Server**, enter the proxy server address and port, and choose **Save**\.

| --- | --- | 
|  3\.0\+ client  |  Ctrl\+Alt\+F12—Disconnect session  |
